Due to time constraints, I've chosen to implement only the essential features. There are several enhancements I would consider for a more robust solution, including:

 - Using the Context API
 - Improved caching mechanisms
 - Enhanced UI design
 - Better Error handling

If you'd like, we can schedule a time to discuss these potential improvements in more detail. Otherwise, I wonâ€™t be investing additional time in this implementation.

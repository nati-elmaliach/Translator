Due to time constraints, I've chosen to implement only the essential features. There are several enhancements I would consider for a more robust solution, including:

 - Improved caching mechanisms
 - Enhanced UI design
 - Better Error handling

If you'd like, we can schedule a time to discuss these potential improvements in more detail.
